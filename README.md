# Hexcasting-Bruteforcer
A simple tool to bruteforce hexcasting greater spell, requires mindsplice staff

Generate Pattern Permutation with the PermutationGenerator.py, then get the resulting list.hexbrute and put it with brute.lua in your mindsplice turtle, then run brute.lua

Note: It does not yet account for symmetrical permutation being the same, the file maybe needlessly big
